# js-clock

This project is a tutorial done through Wes Bos' JavaScript30 challenge.

What I learned from this project was how to integrate date and time into my application,
and how to make my application <i>responsive</i> to those parameters.
I used JavaScript to get the parameters, and css to display them properly. 
 
Thank you for stopping by and happy coding!
